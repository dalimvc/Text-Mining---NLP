<li>All models have OK but not great accuracy. SVM performs slightly better here than other models.</li>
<li>When it comes to other metrics such as precision, recall and F1 score, CNN performs much better than any other model, with KNN performing the worst.</li>
<li>There were no "neutral" tweets in this data set. That's why classification was either to positives or negatives.</li>
<li>SVM was best at predicting positives as positive and also negatives as negatives, while KNN was the worse.</li>
<li>In order to improve results, it would be good to experiment with different structures of for example CNN, for example using different embedding method.</li>
